# Protein-Protein Interaction WebApp

## Overview

The Protein-Protein Interaction WebApp allows users to visualize and analyze interactions between proteins. Utilizing data from the STRING database, this web application provides an interactive and dynamic network graph to explore protein relationships and interactions, which can be particularly useful for researchers and bioinformaticians.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Generates dynamic, animated network graphs of protein interactions using Plotly.
- **High-Confidence Data**: Fetches and displays protein interaction data with a high confidence score.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application interface.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and animated visualizations of the protein interaction network.
- **NetworkX**: For handling and analyzing the network graph structure.
- **Requests**: For fetching data from the STRING database API.

## How to Use

1. **Visit the Web Application**: Go to [Protein-Protein Interaction WebApp](https://ppi-vnmkv.onrender.com).
2. **Input Protein Names**: Enter a list of protein names separated by commas (e.g., TP53, BRCA1, EGFR) in the provided input box.
3. **Generate the Network**: Click the "Generate Network" button to visualize the interactions between the specified proteins.
